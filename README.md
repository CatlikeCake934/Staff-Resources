# Staff-Resources

This is a simple but useful plugin that includes a /report command, that allows players to notify staff when they suspect someone of cheating, and a staff chat (/sc) so staff can communicate amongst themselves privately. This is ideal for PVP servers as well as most servers on Minehut.

Permissions:
sr.chat (Allows user to read and type in staff chat)
sr.report (Allows user to use /report)
sr.* (All Staff Resources permissions)
